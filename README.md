# LcarsUI

A C++20 desktop UI framework. The public API is still evolving.

## S1 minimal edit form

[The V01 edit form](examples/edit_form/README.md) composes labels, buttons, and a single-line field with typed handles and explicit application data connections. The same form runs with Minimal Web and Material-inspired appearances.

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Configuration Release
.\build\Release\lcars_edit_form_web.exe
.\build\Release\lcars_edit_form_material.exe
.\build.ps1 -Configuration Release -CoreOnly
```

`build.ps1` runs all CTests by default. Use `-SkipTests` for a build only or `-Tests <regex>` to select CTests. It can also be launched from Git Bash; the script prioritizes Windows `tar` over Git's GNU `tar` for configure. For the foreground platform checks, use `verify-idle.ps1` on an idle desktop with the required display scales; see its parameters for selecting runs.

The build requires Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, the Windows SDK, clang-cl, CMake and Ninja. Core-only builds omit the native host, OpenGL and font dependencies. The [independent consumer](examples/consumer/main.cpp) shows assembly, validation and layout using only public headers.

Applications retain the handles returned by `Ui::add_text`, `add_button` and `add_label`; the layout accepts those handles. A text source supplies the application-owned value and notification subscription, while a separate explicit immediate, confirmed, or confirmation-group connection supplies the write action. For example:

```cpp
std::u16string model = u"Initial";
std::function<void()> notify_source;
lcars::Ui ui;
auto name = ui.add_text({.id = "profile.name", .kind = lcars::Kind::text}).value.value();
auto save = ui.add_button({.id = "profile.save", .kind = lcars::Kind::button}).value.value();
name.connect_source({[&] { return model; }, [&](std::function<void()> notify) {
    notify_source = std::move(notify);
    return [&] { notify_source = {}; };
}});
ui.connect_confirmation(save, {name}, [&](const std::vector<lcars::TextChange>& changes) {
    model = changes[0].value;
    if (notify_source) notify_source();
    return lcars::ConfirmationResult{};
});
auto changed = name.set_value(u"Station");
auto saved = save.invoke();
auto description = name.describe();
```

Check `Result::status` and query status before using results. Read-only, disabled, expired, wrong-thread and other refusals are observable. Drafts and field history are separate from applied application data. See the consumer for complete connection setup and the [verification record](examples/edit_form/evidence/rework-verification.md) for test scope and platform limits.

## Earlier settings prototype

The earlier settings MVP is preserved unchanged on the **local** branch `prototype/mvp-settings` at `e6d3fb3`. Its sources, targets, persistence and smoke tests are not part of this S1 branch. Applicable core and host regressions remain in the S1 tests.

The native host currently targets Windows and OpenGL 3.3. Full grapheme, RTL, UIA, MCP, multi-page and cross-monitor DPI coverage are outside S1; see the form documentation for the supported text and IME boundaries. Third-party sources and licenses are listed in [third_party/SOURCES.md](third_party/SOURCES.md).
